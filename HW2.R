# I'm considering focusing improvements on pump stations that failed before the 24 hour mark
# with the assumption that the more pumps that are functioning, the less strain there is on the pump
# stations overall. Therefore, increasing some pumps lifespans (but not necessarily all the way to the 48hr mark)
# has the potential to lead to an increased overall mean lifespan. 

# With that in mind, I'm first going to filter the dataset by the pumps which flooded before the 24hr mark.

# In this subset there now are 12 pumps; for 5 of those pumps (336, 353, 384, 406, 368), adding a servo is predicted to extended their lifespans by at least
# 8 hours and past the 24 hour mark. This upgrade would cost $750k. One of these stations (368), however, does have a slope of 10 ft.
# We might consider not upgrading that one with a servo because what we know about slope suggests that could be the bigger problem.

# and work to decrease their slopes by 3ft. This would cost $180k each, a total of $540k. Note: I did calculate the new hours after the
